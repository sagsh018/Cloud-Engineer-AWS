AMIs: EBS vs Instance Stores

=> Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage.
=> Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data
=> EBS-backed instances can be stopped. you will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
=> You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes and you will not lose your data
=> By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

Bonus Tip:

An AMI is just a blueprint for an EC2 instance.
