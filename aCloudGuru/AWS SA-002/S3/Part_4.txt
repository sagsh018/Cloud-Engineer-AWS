=> All Versions : All versions of an object are stored in S3 when versioning is enabled. This includes
    all writes and even if you delete an object.
=> Backup : Can be a great backup tool
=> Cannot be disabled : once enabled versioning on s3 bucket, it cannot be disabled - can be only suspended.
=> Lifecycle Rules : Can be integrated with lifecycle Rules
=> Support MFA : Can support multi-factor authentication

So we can say that, by enabling versioning and multi-factor authentication we can avoid accidental delete for our objects 
in S3.
