Security groups are stateful

=> If you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound 
    security group rules
=> Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of the outbound rules.
=> Security groups are your last line of defence

basically this is how traffic flows in from wither internet Gateway or private VPC Gateway

    => First traffic hits routing table, then it hit Network ACL(NACL) and then finally it hit Security groups.
