Increasing read performance with read replicas

=> Multi AZ

    An exact copy of your production database in another availability zone
    Used for disaster recovery
    In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby instance
    No need to worry about DNS

=> Read replicas

    A read-only copy of your primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region
    Used to increase or scale read performance
    Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database for read-only workloads (e.g. Business intelligence reporting jobs)
