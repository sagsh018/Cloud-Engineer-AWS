Network Load Balancers

Use Cases ::

=> Network load balancers are best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level
    (Layer 4), Network Load Balancers are capable of handling millions of requests per second, while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
=> Use for extreme performance

4 Tips ::

=> Network load balancers are operate at layer 4
=> use where you need extreme performance
=> Other use cases are where you need protocols not supported by application load balancers. That means whereever ports other than 80 and 443 are supported.
=> Network load balancers can decrypt traffic, but you will need to install the certificate on the load balancer.
