AWS PrivateLink

=> If you see a question asking about peering VPCs to tens, hundreds, or thousands of customer VPCs, think of AWS PrivateLink
=> Doesn't require VPC peering, no route tables, NAT gateways, internet gateways, etc 
=> Requires a Network Load Balancer on the service VPC and an ENI on the customer VPC.
