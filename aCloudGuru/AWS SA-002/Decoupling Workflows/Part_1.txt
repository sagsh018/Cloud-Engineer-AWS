=> Never tightly couple : On the exam, avoid answrs that include tight coupling - such as an EC2 instance that is directly communicating to another EC2 instance.
=> While tight coupling is simpler from an architecture perspective, It doesn't offer any meaningful benefits over loose coupling.

Some more exam tips ::

=> Always loosely couple : Even when not specifically asked, loose coupling is answer.

=> Never tightly couple : Don't select answers that include instance-to-instance communication

=> Internal and External : Every level of an application should be loosely coupled

=> One Size : Doesn't fit all. There's no one single decouple.
