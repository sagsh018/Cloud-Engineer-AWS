What can we do with a VPC?

    => Launch instances : Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
    => Custom IP Addresses : Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
    => Route Tables : Configure route tables between subnets
    => Internet Gateway : Create internet gateway and attach it to your VPC
    => More Control : Much better security control over your AWS resources
    => Access Control Lists : Subnet network access control Lists

Bonus Exam Tip : You can use Network Access control list (NACLs) to block specific IP addresses.

Other exam tipes :

=>  Think of VPC as a logical data center in AWS
=> Consists of internet gateways (or virtual private gateways). routing tables, network access control lists, subnets, and security 
    groups
=> 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone
