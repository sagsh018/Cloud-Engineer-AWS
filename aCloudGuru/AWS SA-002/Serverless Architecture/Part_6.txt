Amazon Eventbridge

=> Amazon Eventbridge (formerly known as cloudwatch events) is a serverless event bus. It allows you to pass events from a source to an endpoint.

=> Creating a Rule :

    => Define pattern
        Do you want the rule to be invoked based on an event happening? or do you want to be scheduled?

    => Select Event bus
        Is this going to be an AWS based event ? A custom event ? or a partner ?

    => Select your target 
        What happens when this event kicks off ? Do you trigger a lambda function ? post to an SQS queue ? send an email ?

    => Tag 
        It can't be stressed enough : you need to tag everything

    => Sit back
        wait for the event to happen. or kick off yourself to make sure it's working correctly.

Exam tips :

=> Eventbridge is a Glue

=> Do you want to trigger an action based on something that happened in AWS ? 

=> Eventbridge can do that for you

=> Eventbridge holds together a serverless application and lambda function. Any API call that happens in AWS can alert a lambda function, or a variety of different endpoints, that something 
    has happened.

Some more exam tips :

=> API calls : A very common use case is triggering a lambda functions when a AWS API call happens.

=> New vs Old : Eventbridge is the new name, but you might see cloudwatch events on the exam

=> High level : there's more to eventbridge than rules, but it won't be on the exam

=> Speed : this is the fastest way to respond to things happening in your environment
