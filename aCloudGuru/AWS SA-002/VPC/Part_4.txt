Network ACLs 

=> Default Network ACLs : Your VPC automatically comes with default network ACL, and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
=> Custom Network ACLs : You can create custom network ACLs. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
=> Subnet Associations : Each subnet in you VPC must be associated with network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, 
    the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
=> Block IP addresses : Block IP addresses using network AC:s, not security groups.
=> You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only 1 network ACL at a time. When you associate a network
    ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
=> Network ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule.
=> Network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
=> Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic ( and vice versa)
