Running Containers in ECS or EKS
=================================

Why ECS ?
==========

=> Management of containers at scale : ECS can manage 1, 10, hundreds or thousands of containers. It will appropriately place the containers and keep them online.

=> Role Integration : Containers can have individual roles attached to them, making security a breeze

=> ELB Integration : Containers are appropriately registered with the load balancers as they come online and go offline.

=> Ease of Use : Extreamely easy to set up and scale to handle any workload.

Exam Tips :

=> ECS is preferred over EKS

=> ECS and container go hand in hand on the exam.

=> If you see containers mentioned, you should think ECS

=> The only exception to this is if the question is asking about open source, kubernetes, or running the container on premises. In that situation, you'd want to select EKS.

Some more exam tips :

=> ECS vs EKS

=> Preference : Generally, favor using AWS designed services over third party

=> Open source : Anytime you see open source or kubernetes, think EKS

=> High level : The exam won't ask the specifics of ECS or EKS usage

=> Length : Great for one-off or long-running applications.
