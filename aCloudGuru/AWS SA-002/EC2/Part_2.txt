AWS CLI :

=> Least privilege : Always give your users the minimum amount of access required to do their job.
=> Use Groups : Create IAM groups and assign your users to groups. group permissions are assigned using IAM policy documents.
    your users will automatically inherit the permissions of the group.
=> Secret Access Key : You will only see this once. If you lose it, you can delete the access key ID and secret access key 
    and regenrate them. you will need to run aws configure again.
=> Don't share the key pair : Each developer should have their own access key ID and secret access key. Just like passwords
    they should never be shared.
=> Supports linux, windows, MacOS : You can install the CLI on your MAC, Linux, or Windows PC. You can also use it to on EC2
    instance.
