Messaging with SQS

=> Simple Queue service is a messaging queue that allows asynchronous processing of work. One resource will write a message to an SQS queue, and then another
    resource will retrieve that message from SQS.

=> SQS settings :
    > Delivery Delay : Default is 0; can be set up to 15 min.
    > Message Size : Messages can be up to 256 KB of text in any format.
    > Encryption : Messages are encrypted in transit by default, but you can add at-rest.
    > Message Retention : Default is 4 days; can be set between 1 minute and 14 days
    > Long vs short : :ong polling isn't the default, but it should be.
    > Queue Depth : This can be a trigger for autoscaling.
    > Visibility Timeout : By default is 30 s and can be increased further. Visibility timeout is a time period for which message will be locked by SQS and 
        will b=not be visible for any other consumer.

=> SQS is important. SQS is going to be featured very heavily on the exam. It's important to be able to explain every single setting we've talking about .
