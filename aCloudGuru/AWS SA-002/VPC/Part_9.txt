Direct Connect :

=> Direct connect directly connects your data center to AWS
=> Useful for high-throughput workloads (e.g. lots of network traffic)
=> Helpful when you need a stable and relieable secure connection

VPNs vs Direct Connect :
VPNs allow private communication, but it still traverses the public internet to get the data delivered. While secure , it can be painfully slow

Direct connect is :
    Fast
    secure
    relieable
    Able to take massive throughput

So whenever you get a question where it says that :
    Your VPN keeps droping out 
    you need to reduce your network cost
    You need to increase your network throughput
You can think of Direct connect.
