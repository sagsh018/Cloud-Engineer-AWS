Assign permissions using IAM policy documents consisting of JSON.
Example policy :

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Policy Types :

    > AWS Managed
    > Customer Managed
    > AWS Managed - job function 
    > Customer Inline

If for some action and resource effect is explicitly defined as deny, then it will override all 
other allows
