Intro to Route 53
=================

Top-level-domain

=> If you look at a common domain names (e.g. google.com, bbc.co.uk, and acloud.guru), you will notice a string of characters separated by dots (periods).
=> The last word in a domain name is known as a second level domain name (this is optional, though, and depends on the domain name).

=> Understand the difference between an alias record and a CNAME record
=> Given the choice , always choose an alias record over a CNAME record

So the first thing I'd remember going into the exam
is just understand the difference between an alias
record and a CNAME.
And given the choice in a scenario-based question
always choose an alias record over a CNAME.
Just remember the alias records are unique to AWS.
So it's a way of translating your naked domain name
to a resource.
Could be an Elastic load balancer, an S3 bucket, et cetera.
And it doesn't just have to be the naked domain name.
It could also be a sub domain.
So it could be mobile.hellocloudguru123.com, et cetera.
Whereas a CNAME only allows you to translate
a sub domain names from one to another.
So M might go M.Acloudguru.com.
It might go to mobile.Acloudguru.com, et cetera.
But like I said,
given the choice always choose an alias record
over a CNAME When you see mention of it in your exam.
Also remember going into the exam,
the common DNS record types.
So we've got our start of authority record,
we've got CNAME, we've got our NS records
or name server records
and the record that we've been using throughout
the whole part of this course is our A Records.
And A Records essentially just turn our web addresses
in to IP addresses.

Common DNS Record types

    > SOA Records - Start of authority
    > CNAME record
    > NS Records - Name Server Records
    > A Records
