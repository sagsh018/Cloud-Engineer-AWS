Geoproximity Routing Policy

Traffic Flow :

    > You can use Route 53 traffic flow to build  a routing system that uses a combination of :
        >> Geographic location
        >> latency
        >> and availability to route traffic
    from your users to your cloud or on-premise endpoints

    > You can build your traffic routing policies :
        >> from scratch
        >> or you can pick a template from a library and then customize it.
