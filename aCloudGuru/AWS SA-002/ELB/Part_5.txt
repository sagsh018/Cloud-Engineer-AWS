Sticky Session
===============

=> You can have sticky session used along with Classic load balancers. but with this sometime there is a problem. Suppose if the EC2 instance is terminated, due
    to this sticky session it will keep on sending the request to same EC2 instance and user might get time out as the EC2 instance is no more there.

=> To overcome this we need to disable stcikyness.

=> You can also enable sticky sessions for application load balancers as well. but the traffic will be sent at the target group level. that means, if one of the
    EC2 instance in that target group get fails, the request will be routed to other EC2 instance in taht target group. So not a problem as it is there in
    Classic load balancers.

Exam Tips

=> Sticky sessions :: Enable your users to stick to the same EC2 instance. Can be useful if you are storing information locally to that instance.

=> You may see a scenario-based question where you remove an EC2 instance from a pool. but the load balancer continues to direct traffic to that EC2 instance.

=> To solve a scenario like this, disable sticky sessions.
