Whenever we create any user in AWS IAM, by default it does not have any permissions whatsoever in AWS to do anything.
Identity providers.

What we have learned so far ?

    >> IAM is Universal : It does not apply to regions at this time

    >> The Root Account : This is an account created when you first setup your AWS account and it as complete admin access. Secure it
                            as soon as possible and do not use it to login for day to day activities

    >> New Users : When created does not have any permissions. Add users to groups and assign permissions to users.

    >> Access key ID and secret access keys are not the same as usernames and passwords

    >> You only get to view them once - If you loose them, you have to regenerate them. So, save them in save location

    >> Always setup password rotations - You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.

    >> IAM Federation - With this you can combine your existing username and password with AWS. For example when you log on to your PC 
                        (usually using microsoft Active directory), you can use same credentials to log in to AWS if you setup 
                        federation.

    >> Identity Federation - Uses the SAML standard, which is active directory
