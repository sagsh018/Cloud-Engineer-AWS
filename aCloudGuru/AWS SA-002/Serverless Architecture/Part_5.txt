Removing servers with Fargate 
=============================

=> AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Containers Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

=> AWS owns and manages infrastructure

=> Requires use of ECS or EKS

=> Linux only workloads.

EC2 vs Fargate 
===============

EC2 :

    => You are responsible for underlying outside
    => EC2 pricing model
    => Long-running containers
    => Multiple container share the same host

Fargate :

    => No OS access
    => Pay based on resource allocated and time ran
    => Short running tasks
    => Isolated environments

How does lambda compares ?

Fargate :

    => Select Fargate when you have more consistent workloads
    => Allows Docker use across the organization and a greater level of control by developers

Lambda :

    => Great for unpredictable or inconsistent workloads
    => Perfect for applications that can be expressed as a single function.

Exam Tips 
=========

=> Know the use cases 

=> Your best friend in the exam is knowing when to use lambda vs. Fargate vs EC2

=> Lambda is for light weight functions. Easily integrate with our other AWS services

=> Fargate is when I have containers that do not need to run all the time

=> EC2 is for when I have container that need to run 24*7 365 days a year.

Some more exam tips :

=> Lose the servces : Fargate is a serverless compute option

=> Required Tools : ECS or EKS is a requirement. Fargate doesn't work by itself

=> Fargate vs EC2 : Fargate is more expensive, but easier to use

=> Fargate vs Lambda : Fargate is for containers and applications that need to run longer. Lambda excels at short and simple functions.
