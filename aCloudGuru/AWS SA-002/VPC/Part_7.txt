VPC peering

=> Allows you to connect 1 VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
=> Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
=> You can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account
=> Peering is in a star configuration (e.g. 1 central VPC peers with 4 others)
=> Transitive peering is not supported. This must be always be in a hub-and-spoke model. see part_7.1
=> You can peer between regions
=> No overlapping CIDR address ranges
