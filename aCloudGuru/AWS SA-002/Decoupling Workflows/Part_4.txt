Ordered Messages with SQS FIFO

=> Fifo is the only option : If you ever see a scenario talking about message ordering, scan for answers that include FIFO.

Some more exam Tips:

=> Performance : FIFO queues do not have the same level of Performance
=> Not the only way : You can order the messages with SQS standard as well, but the ordering in this case will on you.
=> Message Group ID : This ensures messages are processed one by one inside the group. So the group may come out of order but the messages inside a group
    will always be in order.
=> FIFO cost more : Fifo costs more since AWS must specnd compute power to deduplicate messages.
