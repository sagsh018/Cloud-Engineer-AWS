Learning EBS:

SSD Volumes (Solid State Disks)

=> Highly available and scalable storage volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance.

Types :

=> General purpose (gp2)
    > Suitable for boot disks and general applications
    > Up to 16000 IOPS per volumes
    > Up to 99.9% durability

=> General purpose SSD (gp3)
    > Suitable for high performance applications
    > Predictable 3000 OPS baseline performance and 125 MB/s regardless of the volume size
    > Up to 99.9% durabiltiy

=> Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
    > Suitable for OLT and latency sensitive applications
    > 50 IOPS/GB
    > Up to 64000 IS per volume
    > High performance and most expensive
    > Up to 99.9% durability

=> Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
    > Suitable for OLT and latency sensitive applications
    > 500 IOPS/GB
    > Upto 64000 IOPS per volume
    > 99.999 % durability
    > Latest generation Provisioned IOPS volume.

HDD volumes (Hard Disk Drives)

=> Highly available and scalable storage volumes you can attach to an EC2 instance.

Types :

=> Throughput Optimized (st1)
    > Suitable for big data, data werehouses, and ETL
    > Max throughput is 500 MB/s per volume
    > Cannot be a boot volume
    > Up to 99/9% durability

=> Cold HDD(sc1)
    > Max throughput of 250 MB/s per volume
    > Less frequently accessed data
    > Cannot be a boot volume
    > Lowest cost
    > Up to 99.9% durability
