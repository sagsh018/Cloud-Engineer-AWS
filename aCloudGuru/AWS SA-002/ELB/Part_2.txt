Application Load Balancers

=> An Application load balancer functions at application layer- the seventh layer of OSI model
=> After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects
    a target from the target group for the rule action.
=> Listeners : A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port you configure
=> Rules : Determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or 
    more conditions
=> Target Groups : Each target group ruotes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number you specify.
=> Limitations : Application load balancers only support HTTP and HTTPS.
=> HTTPS : To use an HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS server certificate on your load balancer. The load balancer uses a server certificate
    to terminate the frontend connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the targets.
