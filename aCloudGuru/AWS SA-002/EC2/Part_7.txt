=> Spread placement groups
    Individual critical EC2 instances
=> Partition placement groups
    mulitple EC2 instances, HDFS, HBase and Cassandra

=> Cluster placement group can't span multiple Availability Zones, whereas a spread placement group and partition placement group can
=> Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (compute optimized, GPU optimized, memory optimized, Storage optimized)
=> AWS recommends homogenous instances wthin cluster placement groups
=> you can't merge placement groups
=> you can move an existing instance into a placement group. before you move the instance, the instance must be in stopped state. you can move or remove an 
    instance using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK, but you can't do it via the console yet.
