=> Logs should go to Cloudwatch logs, except for situation where we don't need to process them and we don't need to see them in real time then, they should go 
    to straight s3. 

=> So in exam, if question talks about only storing and no processing or real time viewing, then they can be shipped to s3.

=> You need to have a high-level understanding of what servies act as a source for cloudwatch logs. for example : EC2 , lambda, cloudtrail, RDS, on-prim and many 
    more are all source for the cloudwatch logs
