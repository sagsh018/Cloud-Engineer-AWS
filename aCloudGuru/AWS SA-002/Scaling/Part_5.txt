Scaling Relational Databases :

=> Scaling vs. Refactoring ::
    You will be given scenarios and, unless otherwise specified, refactoring and changing to DynamoDB is viable scaling choice.
    It won't work that easy in the real world, but in the exam switching database types can solve the problem, if DynamoDB exist in the options.

Other Tips ::

Read Replicas : Read-heavy workloads = Read replicas.

Careful with storage : RDS storage only scales up - it won't scale back down

Verticle scaling : Don't shy away from this scaling types

Multi-AZ : Unless its dev environment turn this on

Aurora everthing : Whenever possible, use Aurora it the situation calls for a relational database.
