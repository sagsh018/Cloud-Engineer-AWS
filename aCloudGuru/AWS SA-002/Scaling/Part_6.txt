Scaling Non-Relational Databases 
================================

Pinch Those Pennies !

=> Keep cost in mind rather than performance when scaling DynamoDB.
=> The exam will generally approach it from a cost perpective.
=> Predictive Workload ? : Pick a provisioned capacity
=> Sporadic ? : Pick on-demand.

Exam Tips :

=> Access Patterns : Know if its predictable or unpredictable
=> Design Matters : Avoiding hot keys will also lead to better performance
=> Switching : you can switch, but only once per 24 hours per table
=> Cost : Keep cost in mind when considering which type of table to pick.
