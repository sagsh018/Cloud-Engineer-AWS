Geolocation Routing policy

=> Use case : For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for your European
    customers.

=> In this example, Route 53 will send the European customers to eu-west-1 and the US customers to us-east-1. Please see Part_4.1

You may get a scenario based question where, you have users in different part of the world and you need to send them to different regions based on there 
End locations

So if you see any such question where its talking about location of your users and you need to send them to perticular country for ragulatory may be, 
 and not talking about latency, then you must choose geolocation routing.
