Can you do this yourself in the AWS Management Console ?

=> If yes, you are likely responsible.
    Security groups, IAM users, patching EC2 operating systems, patching databases running on EC2, etc.

=> If not, AWS is likely responsible.
    Management of data centers, security cameras, cabling, patching RDS operating systems, etc
