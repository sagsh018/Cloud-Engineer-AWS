EBS volumes and snapshot

=> Volums exist on EBS, whereas snapshot exist on s3
=> Snapshot are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature
=> The first snapshot will take some time to create. For consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volume.
=> You can share the snapshot between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region
=> You can reize the EBS volme on the fly as well as changing the volume types.
