Data Streams and Data Firehose

=> There are 2 major types of Kinesis you need to be familiar with.

=> Data Streams
    Purpose : Real -time streaming for ingesting data

    Speed : Real time

    Difficulty : you're responsible for creating the consumer and scaling the stream.

=> Data Firehose 
    Purpose : Data transfer tool to get information to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, or splunk

    Speed : Near real time (within 60 seconds)

    Difficulty : Plug and play with AWS architecture 

=> When we're looking for a message broker, which do we pich?
    SQS : SQS is a messageing broker that is simple to use and doesn't require much configuration. It doesn't offer real-time 
            message delivery

    Kinesis : Kinesis is a bit more complicated to configure and is mostly used in big data applications. It does provide real-time
            communication.


Exam Tips 

=> Real Time ? Think Kinesis 

=> There are very few services in AWS that offer "real-time" processing. Kinesis is one of the few services that offer this Speed
    So if you see real-time than go with kinesis streams and if you see near real time streaming then go with kinesis data 
    Firehose

=> So if you're faced with a question that asks for a real-time processing or streaming of data, look for an answer
    that includes Kinesis.

Some more tips :

=> Kinesis VS SQS : Both are message brokers, but the only kinesis is real time

=> Scaling : Data streams does not automatically scale. Data firehose does

=> Transforming data : Data analytics is the easiest way to process data going through kinesis using SQL.
